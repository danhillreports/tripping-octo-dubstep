Code for the [stepper map](http://danhillreports.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/step-map/) featured in my [blog](http://danhillreports.com/?p=683) about the design virtues of stepper maps.

Inspired by [the taco app](http://timeline.chicagotribune.com/chi-fox-valley-taco-tour-20130422/step/chi-fox-valley-taco-tour-intro-20130423), [StoryMapJS](http://storymap.knightlab.com/) and hacking with [Ryan Nagle](https://github.com/rnagle).
